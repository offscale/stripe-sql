    A PaymentIntent guides you through the process of collecting a payment from your customer.

    We recommend that you create exactly one PaymentIntent for each order or
    customer session in your system. You can reference the PaymentIntent later to
    see the history of payment attempts for a particular session.

    A PaymentIntent transitions through
    [multiple statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses)
    throughout its lifetime as it interfaces with Stripe.js to perform
    authentication flows and ultimately creates at most one successful charge.
